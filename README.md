## My process
I decided to use Chakra UI for this project as I wanted to continue learning about it and I just find it convinient to use. I start by defining the Colors and Fonts that I will be using in the project and hook those up. Then I started by building the obviously repeating large components such as the cards and primary button. From there I build smaller components and try to make them as customizable as necessary for their different layouts and states. 

### Built with
- React.JS
- Chakra UI
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a couple of hooks that come with Chakra UI for handling things like Media Queries and Modals. Really handy tools that really justify working with Chakra UI to be a breeze.
